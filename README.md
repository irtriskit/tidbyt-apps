# Tidbyt Apps

This repository serves as a home for the custom apps I build for my [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.dev/).

## D&D Beyond Character Info

The `char_info` app will display your character's hit points and/or death saves status from D&D Beyond. You will need to provide your character ID and the value from your `CobaltSession` cookie. This is a long-term session token that the app uses to authenticate and make a request to the API.
